        <h6>Personal Statement</h6>
        <p>Promise is driven to buck the system, to innovate, to disrupt traditional systems, to take things beyond where they have been, finding paths and blaizing trails for the good and benefit of mankind</p>
        <p>We should not be fixated on ideologies because they do not solve problems. Rather, we need to be a bit manipulative sometimes to get the better outcomes we desire.</p>
        <p>Chaos is order, yet undeciphered.</p>
        <p>Every process I have been through, has gravitated towards Agriculture & Environment - my first love "Curiosity is the key to all wisdom"</p>
